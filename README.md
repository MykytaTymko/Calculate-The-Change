# CalculatetheChange
 First test assignment for BlackRock for the Software Engineering position.

The task is to find the minimum number of coins to issue change. I solved this problem using dynamic programming, not a greedy algorithm. This was done so that any coin
denominations could be transferred. The only thing is that all calculations are made in kopecks (that is, the initial data is multiplied by 100).
